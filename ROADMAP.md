## Ideas (Unvalidated)

- `pomodoro` - Timed work session with structured breaks
- `weekly-planning` - Proactive week setup (vs reactive review)
- `energy-check` - Match task to current energy level
- `delegate` - Capture something to ask/assign to someone else
- `waiting-for` - Track things blocked on others

## Design Principles

All skills follow [ADHD-PRINCIPLES.md](./references/ADHD-PRINCIPLES.md):
- One thing at a time
- Celebrate wins first
- Compassionate accountability
- Low friction
- External memory
